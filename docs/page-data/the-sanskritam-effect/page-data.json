We wanted to find out how such intense verbal memory\\ntraining affects the physical structure of their brains. Through the India-Trento Partnership for Advanced Research (ITPAR),\\nwe recruited professional Vedic pandits from several government-sponsored schools in the Delhi region; then we used structural\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at India\\u2019s National Brain Research Center to scan the brains of pandits and controls matched for\\nage, gender, handedness, eye-dominance and multilingualism.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What we discovered from the structural MRI scanning was remarkable.

Our brains\\nhave two hippocampi, one on the left and one on the right, and without them we cannot record any new information. Many memory functions\\nare shared by the two hippocampi. The right is, however, more specialized for patterns, whether sound, spatial or visual, so the large\\ngray matter increases we found in the pandits\\u2019 right hippocampus made sense: accurate recitation requires highly precise sound pattern\\nencoding and reproduction.
